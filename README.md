# imageComponent
In this code, the display property is set to grid, and the gridTemplateColumns and gridTemplateRows properties are used to define the grid with 3 rows and 2 columns.

The gridGap property is used to add some space between the grid cells.

Each image is wrapped in a div element with the backgroundImage, backgroundSize, backgroundRepeat, and height properties set to display the images side by side.

The gridRow and gridColumn properties are used to position each div element in the grid, with values ranging from 1 / 2 to 3 / 4.

You can replace the your-image-url-* placeholders with the URLs of the images you want to display.
